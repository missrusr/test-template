[React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) Template for [@uiw/react-native](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-native-uiw). 


> Migrate from @uiw/react-native-template 0.1.2 to [v1.1.0](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-native-template/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

## Features

This template includes the following:

- Elegant usage directly within the [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) 0.60 support (now with Hooks! üôå).
- Easy to use and understand folder structure to get you up and running as fast as possible.
- [@uiw/react-native](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-native-uiw) component framework and themes.
- Using [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) to routing and navigate your React Native applications.
- [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) support (with [@rematch](https://github.com/rematch/rematch) example)
- [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint), and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) configured out-of-the-box
- Using [mocker-api](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/mocker-api) that creates mocks for REST APIs.

## Installation and Usage

‚ö†Ô∏è This template only works with the new CLI. This template is intended for React Native versions `>= 0.61`. It has not been tested with previous versions. 

**Note on the legacy CLI**

‚ö†Ô∏è There seems to be quite some confusion about the legacy CLI. This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`), for the below command to work. 

```bash
npm uninstall -g react-native-cli
```

Further information can be found here: https://github.com/react-native-community/cli#about

**`react-native@0.61.0` or higher**

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template @uiw/react-native-template
# npx react-native init MyApp --template @uiw/react-native-template@v1.0.0
```

**If you wish to not use `npx`**

you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).

```bash
npx react-native init MyApp --template @uiw/react-native-template
```

```bash
# This will initialize new project using template from TEMPLATE_NAME package
npx react-native init ProjectName --template ${TEMPLATE_NAME}

# This will initialize new project using init command from react-native@VERSION
# but will use TEMPLATE_NAME custom template
npx react-native@${VERSION} init ProjectName --template ${TEMPLATE_NAME}
```

## Dependencies

```bash
@react-navigation/native
